## 🧠 How does it work?

The program guides you through a series of tactical and positional questions to calculate your score in the following categories:

- **Tactician:** Focus on combinations and sacrifices.
- **Positional:** Slow play, improvement of pieces and structure.
- **Dynamic:** Initiative and imbalances.
- **Theorist:** Memorization and preparation of openings.
- **Intuitive:** Pattern recognition and “feeling.”

At the end, you will receive your **primary style** and **suggested openings** for White and Black.
